1. Clean up. Documentation
2. Add a map selector.
3. Shapes in retrieve data option. (Partially done. Export to CSV allows you to specifically select the region you want. However, combining the rectangular range with the SHAPE specified is what I want to target next)
4. Give user option to choose projection, colors etc

5. The output is visible only for the last added one. Shift to a design with only one output box?
6. Create and display statistics for the data.
7. Use dictionaries instead of names everywhere?

##TODO. Merge the common parts of the two functions into a map init called at the start of both functions?
##Look into time-varying graphs and how they can be plotted.
## Write code for non-map graphs.
